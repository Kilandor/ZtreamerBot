# ZtreamerBot
Brings UDP payload support, allowing the game to send and receive messages from tools such as Streamer.bot. On its own, this plugin does nothing — it requires integration with another plugin or implementation through a Zua script.

## Dependencies
ZeepSDK [Mod.io](https://mod.io/g/zeepkist/m/zeepsdk) - [Github](https://github.com/donderjoekel/ZeepSDK/)

## Features
- Receive UDP payloads for integration with other plugins or Zua scripts
- Send UDP broadcasts to share data or respond to third-party programs
- Start or stop the server at any time — no need to relaunch the game
- Customizable port configuration
- Optional auto-start on game launch

## Special Credit
- [Metalted](https://github.com/metalted) - Created the original plugin.
